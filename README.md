# Developer log analyzer

This project is a lightweight Python tool designed to analyze structured or semi-structured log files and generate clear, developer-friendly summaries. It was created as a foundational project to explore how tooling can improve observability, debugging, and system understanding in distributed environments.

## Current Scope

- Read and parse log or text-based input files
- Extract relevant events or metrics
- Output a summarized, human-readable report

## Planned Extensions

- AI-assisted summarization of logs using LLMs
- Pattern detection and anomaly highlighting
- Improved developer-facing output and tooling

## How to Run

```bash
python3 src/main.py
